Who I Am
======
My name is Tixiao Shan. I am currently studying at Stevens Institute of Technology and living in New York City.

What I’m Up to
======
I am currently a graduate student pursuing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics at Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT). As a Robotics Researcher working in Robots Field Autonomy Lab, my main focus has been autonomous navigation encompassing localization, mapping and motion planning. Over the last year my research has broadened to include machine learning and underwater navigation. I also have a sound knowledge of computer programming, creating tight, bug free software  and optimizing algorithms. I like working as part of a team where people can learn by feeding off of each others’ ideas.
