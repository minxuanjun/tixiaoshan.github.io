Who I Am
======
My name is Tixiao Shan. I am currently studying at Stevens Institute of Technology and living in New York City.

What I’m Up to
======
I am currently a graduate student pursuing my PhD in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics at Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT). As a Robotics Researcher working in [Robots Field Autonomy Lab](http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/), my main focus has been autonomous navigation encompassing localization, mapping and motion planning. I have developped lightweight [lidar odometry](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM), [traversability mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pdBpeRGXmw&t=4s), various [sampling-based motion planning algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6lrbAEhEnE) running in real-time on embedded system. Over the last year my research has broadened to include machine learning and underwater navigation. I achieved [lidar super-resolution](https://youtu.be/rNVTpkz2ggY) using a deep neural network. I also have a sound knowledge of computer programming, creating tight, bug free software and optimizing algorithms. I like working as part of a team where people can learn by feeding off of each others’ ideas.
