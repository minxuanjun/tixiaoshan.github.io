Who I Am
======
My name is Tixiao Shan. I am a lawful permanent resident living in New York City. Starting from September 2019, I will work as a postdoctoral associate at MIT Senseable City Lab on the project "[Roboat](http://roboat.org/)", under the supervision of Professor [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus) (CSAIL) and Professor [Carlo Ratti](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/carlo-ratti) (Senseable City Lab).

What I’m Up to
======
I obtained my PhD in Mechanical Engineering on Robotics at Stevens Institute of Technology. As a robotics researcher worked in [Robust Field Autonomy Lab](http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/) that is directed by [Dr. Brendan Englot](http://personal.stevens.edu/~benglot/people.html), my main focus has been autonomous navigation encompassing localization, mapping and motion planning. I have developped [lightweight lidar odometry](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM), [traversability mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pdBpeRGXmw&t=4s), various sampling-based motion planning algorithms running in real-time on embedded system. Over the last few years my research has broadened to include machine learning and underwater navigation. I achieved [lidar super-resolution](https://youtu.be/rNVTpkz2ggY) using a deep neural network. Please visit my [Research page](https://tixiaoshan.github.io/research/) to have a closer look at my research activities. I also have a sound knowledge of computer programming, creating tight, bug free software and optimizing algorithms. I like working as part of a team where people can learn by feeding off of each others’ ideas.
